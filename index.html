Web development played a crucial role in bringing these ideas to life, but creating the website was just the beginning. I also dove headfirst into the world of product design. I spent countless hours researching materials, testing prototypes, and refining my designs. It was a challenging process—there were setbacks, unexpected complications, and moments where I questioned whether I had bitten off more than I could chew. But each challenge only fueled my determination to succeed.
<br><br>
Looking back, creating my business was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life. It tested my skills, pushed me to grow, and ultimately allowed me to combine my passions in a way that few people get to experience. And while the journey was far from easy, it was exactly what I had dreamed it would become.

BoxBoxBoxx - 2024

The idea for my own business started as a small spark during my time as a developer at Wiivv. I enjoyed the work, the challenges, and the creative process, but there was always a part of me that wanted a project that was entirely my own, where I could blend my passion for web development with my interest in designing products that people love. 
<br><br>
That spark grew into a fully-fledged vision where products could be brought to life through the power of the web. I then decided to take the plunge and start BoxBoxBoxx. The early days were a whirlwind of ideas, planning, and a bit of self-doubt. I knew that creating a business from the ground up was no small feat, but my past experience had given me the skills and confidence I needed.

As I worked on the project, I found myself experimenting with new coding techniques, pushing my skills in ways I hadn’t before. I wanted every detail to be perfect, from the way the pages loaded to the subtle hover effects that added a bit of magic to the user experience.
<br><br>
When the site finally went live, it was incredibly rewarding to see the response. Joyride customers loved the new online store, and the founder couldn’t have been happier with how well it represented their brand. The website didn’t just drive sales; it became a key part of their marketing strategy, helping to grow their online presence and connect with candy lovers across the country.
<br><br>
Looking back, the Joyride project was one of my favorite freelance gigs. It challenged me to be both a developer and a designer, and it allowed me to bring a small business’s vision to life in a way that felt meaningful. It wasn’t just about building a website; it was about creating a joyful, memorable experience for everyone who visited.

                                        When I first heard about Joyride, I was instantly intrigued. A unique candy startup with a twist on classic sweets, which had a passionate following. The founder, Ryan, had built a brand that was both playful and nostalgic, but there was one thing missing; a website. I was tasked to build a site that captured the essence of their quirky identity and could help them reach a broader audience.
                                        <br><br>
I started by diving deep into their brand. I wanted the website to feel like a digital candy store with vibrant, fun, and whimsical vibes. I sketched out designs that incorporated bold colors, playful fonts, and interactive elements that echoed the joy of unwrapping a sweet treat. The homepage would feature a carousel of their best-sellers, each one with a unique, colorful animation.

However, JavaScript demanded more complex features like asynchronous programming, closures, and managing states across different components. These concepts initially seemed foreign. I found myself struggling with JavaScript’s quirks, spending hours debugging code that didn’t behave the way I expected, but I didn't back down from the challenge.
<br><br>
Slowly but surely, I began to understand JavaScript’s intricacies, and those challenging features became less intimidating. My growth wasn’t just technical; I also became more confident in problem-solving and collaboration. I learned to ask for help when needed, and my teammates were more than willing to share their insights. As I thrived in the rest of the development process, I became a valuable asset to the company.
<br><br>
Eventually, it came time for Wiivv to sell the company and effectively lay off all employees. By the time I left, I was no longer the novice developer who struggled with JavaScript. Instead, I was a well-rounded web developer, capable of tackling complex challenges with confidence, and my time at Wiivv laid the foundation for a successful career in web development.

                                        Starting my career as a fresh web developer was both exciting and daunting. Wiivv, known for its innovative approach to custom-fit products, was a dynamic place filled with creativity and cutting-edge technology. I was eager to dive into the world of web development, bringing a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and a budding interest in the intricacies of JavaScript.                                    
<br><br>
From the moment I joined, I was thrown into a fast-paced environment where every project felt like a new challenge. The team was collaborative, and I quickly found my footing in front-end development, working on user interfaces that needed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. CSS animations and responsive design became my playground, and I enjoyed the creative freedom that came with it.

I then moved on to something more interactive: Rock, Paper, Scissors. This project was a leap forward, introducing me to concepts like random number generation, conditional statements, and handling user input. I spent hours tweaking the logic and adding little details like a score tracker and auto-play. Each feature I implemented taught me a new aspect of coding, and I began to see how small, modular pieces of code could come together to create a complete application.
<br><br>
Encouraged by my progress, I decided to tackle a classic game: Tic-Tac-Toe. This project was a milestone in my learning journey. It required me to think more strategically about game logic and user experience. I experimented with different ways to check for a winner, optimize the code, and create a responsive design that worked on both desktops and mobile devices. The sense of accomplishment I felt when I finally played a full game on your own creation was unmatched.
<br><br>
Throughout this journey, coding became more than just a skill—it became a passion. Every project, no matter how small, was a stepping stone that expanded my knowledge and creativity. I started to see the world differently, recognizing the code behind everyday tools and thinking about how I could build them yourself.

                                        My coding journey began with the curiosity to understand how things worked behind the scenes of the web. A while back I had messed around with some html and css elements on my Myspace page and the idea of creating something purely through lines of code, fascinated me. I didn’t want to start with something overly complex and wanted to build something fun that would teach me the fundamentals along the way.
                                        <br><br>
My first project was a calculator. It seemed straightforward enough, and I quickly discovered that even the simplest applications required careful thought and planning. I learned the basics of HTML to structure the calculator, CSS to style it, and then JavaScript to make it functional. Every time I hit the equals button and the correct answer appeared, it felt like magic—a small victory that fueled my excitement to keep learning.
